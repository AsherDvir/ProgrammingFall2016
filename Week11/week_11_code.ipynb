    "\n",
    "Our goal for the day is to become familiar with convex optimization problems in R. We would like to achieve the following objectives:\n",
    "1. Learn about Python and compare it to R (and other languages).\n",
    "2. See a simple Python script.\n",
    "3. Introduce the simplest components of Python programming.\n",
    "4. Introduce data types in Python.\n",

    "# Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Python?\n",
    "Python is a programming language.  More specifically, python is an interpreted, object oriented programming language.  This means that Python is not compiled like C, but fed into the Python interpreter from the command line (or a script).  This makes the Python workflow much smoother and easier to understand.   Beyond technical issues, Python's syntax is very user friendly and has made it the first choice for programming courses.  In fact, many economics departments already offer Python courses and MIT recently switched all of their introductory computer science courses to Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How is Python different from the other tools we use?\n",
    "The programs I'm refering to are R, Stata, Matlab.  These are not programming languages.  Stata and Matlab are proprietary software that costs money, while R is an open source software package for statistics.  R gets around the problem of having to pay for your calculations, but its syntax is not intuitive and it is geared solely towards statisticians.  Matlab can compete with Python on parallelism, but it cannot compare in terms of capability on several other metrics: currentness, price, strings, portability, classes, and functions.  Overall, the beauty of Python is that it was designed by computer programmers for their own needs and the code is constantly being updated and improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Who uses Python and what are its main features?\n",
    "Who uses it:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Yahoo maps\n",
    "* Google!\n",
    "* Tons of computer games\n",
    "* Disney animators\n",
    "* NASA's Johnson Space Center and Los Alomos National Laboratories Theoretical Physics Division (#PhysicsEnvy)\n",
    "* The CIA website\n",
    "\n",
    "But what about in academia?  Just googling \"'school name' economics python\" for the top ten programs according to US news, the following programs either have high performance computing interests using Python or courses in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "* UPenn\n",
    "* NYU Stern\n",
    "* Harvard Institute for Quantitative Social Science\n",
    "* Chicago\n",
    "* Kellogg\n",
    "* Columbia\n",
    "\n",
    "On top of this, Python is fast becoming the intructory programming language for teaching.  For instance, MIT recently switched all of their intro computer programming courses to Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are its main features? \n",
    "\n",
    "(this list borrowed from 'A Byte of Python' by Patrick Flemming)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Simplicity.  Very streamlined syntax makes it easy to read.\n",
    "* Free!\n",
    "* High level.  You don't need to manage memory usage, all of that is done under the hood.\n",
    "* Portable.  Works on practically any operating system.\n",
    "* Interpreted.  No compiling.  When you run a script, the interpreter translates that into Bytecodes and then to the native language to run.  This actually makes Python slightly slower than, for example, C++, but much easier to use.  However, you can use modules to compile your programs to C if you really care all that much!\n",
    "* Object oriented.  Python uses method attributes (we'll go over that later) to make object oriented programming easy, but it also supports procedure oriented programming as well.\n",
    "* Extensible.  Python plays nice with C.\n",
    "* Libraries!!!!  So many libraries, you won't know where to start.\n"

    "This example illustrates some of the basic points of Python programming and syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Docstring.** A docstring is a 'string literal' that informs the reader (not the computer!) of the usage for a program, function, module, etc.  It is good practice to include information about your program at the beginning so that others, and you for that matter, can figure out what it is for later.  I got this habit from Tom Sargent's Quant Econ course and have used it religiously (although I dont always remember to change the modification date...).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Import statements.** One of the great things about Python is that you can pick and choose what functionality you would like.  This is where import statements come in.  At the beginning of your program you tell Python exactly what modules and packages you would like.  It is possible to import entire modules, but this is frowned upon.  You should be specific in order to keep your program light.  We will come back to the syntax later, but here we are importing the numpy and matplotlib modules and defining more compact names for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Comments.** In python you can comment text using the #, or a multiline comment can be surrounded by three quotation marks: `\"\"\"This is commented. \"\"\"`.  There are certain comment style standards laid out in PEP8:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Comments should be complete sentences.\n",
    "  2. Use two spaces after a period.\n",
    "  3. Comments should be in English (sorry French folk)\n",
    "  4. Use block comments instead of inline comments (or at least use in line comments sparingly)\n",
    "  5. Write Docstrings!\n",
    "\n",
    "  In general, save the multiline comment for docstrings.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Variable definition.** In Python you use the '=' sign for variable definitions.  Variable type is assumed based on the definition, but you can define the variable more precisely if you'd like.  In general, Python variables are local in scope, that is they are defined for use within a function or program.  However, you should be careful to use different variable names in different functions, as if Python cannot find a variable in the local 'namespace', then it will move to the global namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Function call.** When you call a function in Python, you simply pass it the required arguments.  Things can get more complicated, but we will discuss this later.  When you import a module, the module itself is an object.  This is sort of a philosophical point, but pretty much everything in Python, functions, modules, variables, etc., is an object.  Given this, you can reference methods of those objects.  Here, when we do `plt.plot(foo)`, we are actually telling the computer to go into matplotlib and find the plot function, then to run that function on the variable foo.  This is the idea behind object oriented programming.  I know, this was a very short explanation, but either I wave some hands or I write a book.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Methods.** Throughout the example you'll notice the syntax of `object.method`.  This is a very pythonic way of programming, as everything in Python is an object, be it a variable you have defined or a module you import.  A \"method\" is a function or attribute defined within the class to which the object belongs.  We're getting ahead of ourselves, but it suffices to know that this syntax refers to a method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Behond these basic parts to a Python program, there is a lot of focus on syntax and style in the community.  This is why after 25 years the language is still concise and clear.  To get an idea of the philosophy behind python style, run the following cell:"

    "## Modules and packages\n",
    "\n",
    "A module is a way for Python to save definitions for later use.  A module file simply contains the definitions of functions, classes, etc., and you can write your own if you want to.  Modules can also contain executable statements that are run the first time the code is used, ie when you import.  It is important to note that when you import a module, the system will search in your PYTHONPATH, a system variable that you may have to define yourself (I think on the newest version of Anaconda this is not a problem, but I'm not sure...).\n",
    "\n",
    "A package is a larger container of modules.  For instance, Matplotlib is a package and pyplot is a module.  This is simply a vocabulary issue.  You'll just import the stuff you need!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a list of some of the most useful packages for economists (or anybody, really):\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Numpy.** This is probably the most used package in Python, and if not it's definitely the most used by scientists.  It includes mainly the numpy array object and related linear algebra operators.  Along with that it has some random number and Fourier transform capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Scipy.** The 'Scipy Stack' actually incorporates most of the packages in this list, as well as some others.  If you are talking about the 'Scipy Library' then you are referring to the namesake package that includes numerical routines.  The part you'll use most is probably the numerical integration and optimization, but it also has great interpolation, sparse matrices, statistics, and linear algebra capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Matplotlib.** An object oriented plotting utility.  This package can be very easy to use, but also offers amazing customizability which, when combined with third party packages, can match any graphics software on the market.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Pandas.** A data analysis library.  Contains the DataFrame object (which is what everyone in this course is probably interested in), as well as multidimensional panel objects for panel data (I'm just learning about these! so neat!), and series objects.  It also contains some statistical functions, but the most useful things are IO and data munging.  You can use Pandas to read in large amounts of data in almost any format and write to almost anything, including HDF5 which allows you to work with 'bigdata'.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **StatModels.** A module for statistics.  It seems to me to be a lot of econometric methods, and given that the founder is an econometrician it is probably pretty focused on stuff you will be interested in!  Alongside a lot of the functionality, you get some nice statistical plotting as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Requests.** This is probably less useful (for an economist, but very useful for others!), but if you ever want to automate data retrieval you'll need to use http.  Requests makes this easy.  Their slogan is 'HTTP for Humans', which is pretty self explanatory.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Beautiful Soup.** Again this is not as useful.  This is a simple and easy to use module for parsing, navigating, searching, and modifying a document.  This is particularly useful if you need to do any webscraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Scrapy.** This module helps you to create web crawlers that you can use to gather data on the web.  It even generates the file tree for you.  I actually find this kind of terrifying, but you might find it useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sympy.** This is a symbolic algebra package that can do simplification, polynomial expansions, symbolic calculus, equation solving, combinatronics, and tons of other neat stuff!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data structures\n",
    "Python's data structures are, like everything else, object oriented.  In this sense, each one has special methods that can be used to manipulate it.  Here's a list of some of the basic data structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "* List\n",
    "* String\n",
    "* Tuple\n",
    "* Set\n",
    "* Dictionary\n",
    "* Numpy Array\n",
    "* Pandas DataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of these data types will come up in this course, but we can't cover everything.  You should take some time to read <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#\" target=\"_blank\">the documentation</a> on these so that you are at least familiar with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing in Python begins at zero and you can reference an item in a list, string, or tuple by its index.  You can also reference a numpy array using indices, and in higher dimensions these are much easier to deal with than list indices.  Dictionaries and DataFrames use keys to keep track of their contents.  We will discuss DataFrames in more depth when we talk about Pandas.  For now, we will talk just about the native list, string, tuple, and dictionary types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lists\n",
    "A list some useful methods that you should look up in the <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range\" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a>, such as pop, append, and sort.  Two of the most useful methods with lists, though, are list comprehensions and lists as iterators."
