    "\n",
    "Before we get to the nitty gritty, let's take a minute to consider why this is a good idea, particularly from your perspective as a graduate student in economics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open source computing is a wonderful thing, but it can sometimes seem like a useless amount of extra work to publish your own code. Here are some reasons you should really consider doing this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **\"You are an intellectual entrepreneur.\"** That's a quote from Stephen Magee (possibly the happiest guy I ever met), one of my teachers in undergrad. He was referring to an academic's job to not only do research, but to sell their ideas to the world. You will only be truly successful if you can convince other people that you are important. One easy way to do so is to create a portfolio of open-source computing projects which you have either started or contributed to.\n",
    "2. **Building competence.** The only way to learn how to code is to code, but the only way to learn how to write good, clean code is to let experienced programmers critique your work. You can get this kind of criticism by contributing to an open source project.\n",
    "3. **Getting a job.** When you go on the job market, you are going to look exactly like everyone else. You are a graduate student from a decently ranked, European university with, most likely, no publication record. One way to stand out is by showing that you are contributing to the community through computing tools.\n",
    "4. **Giving back.** All the code we are using in this class is open source: R, jupyter, Github, etc. People just like you set aside their free time to make it possible to use these tools for free, so why not do the same?"

    "2. Discuss neat packages that are available.\n",
    "3. Discuss the benefits of creating your own packages.\n",
    "4. Learn how to create a package from start to finish.\n",
    "5. Learn how to publish your code.\n",
    "6. Learn about collaboration using Github.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Homework:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. I've created a folder called \"class_packs\" in the Week5 folder of the course repo into which you will put your responses, so be sure to sync your local repo!\n",
    "2. Create a blank package using your preffered method within your own, personal local repository.\n",
    "3. Set up this package to run whatever function you want. I would prefer it be a different function than the one from class. Be sure to document your function.\n",
    "5. Choose a license and fill in the `DESCRIPTION` file.\n",
    "6. Generate the documentation using the `document()` command.\n",
    "7. Install your package and make sure it works.\n",
    "10. Push the changes to your own repo.\n",
    "11. Copy and paste your package into the \"class_packs\" folder. 12. Add and commit your changes to the course repository.\n",
    "13. Now open a <a href=\"https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/\" target=\"_blank\">pull request</a> and I will merge your changes into the library! **NOTE:** This may be troublesome at first, as we haven't done it yet, but it is pretty straight forward!"
