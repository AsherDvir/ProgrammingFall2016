    "1. Understand how a computer solves optimization problems.\n",
    "2. Learn to program optimzation with a conditional break.\n",
    "4. Learn about R's built in optimization methods.\n",
    "5. Introduce non-convex optimization ideas (if time permits... although just barely even then).\n",

    "## A Working Example : Root Finding\n",
    "Although this class is about optimization, we are mainly going to be talking about root finding. We will focus on **gradient-based optimization (GBO)**, which uses the fact that **a local extremum is found at a point where the gradient is zero**.\n",
    "\n",
    "All GBO algorithms are built around this idea, that a local optimum has a zero first derivative. Because of this, gradient based optimization is really just **root finding**, or looking for the point where a function equals zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get an idea of how a GBO algorithm works, consider minimizing the following function:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "g(x) = \\frac{b}{4} (x - c)^4\n",
    "$$\n",
    "which we know takes a global minimum at $x = c$. But if you didn't know this, how would you propose to find a solution? \n",
    "\n",
    "To use a GBO algorithm, we first take the first derivative of a function and look for its root. That is, we try to find the solution to the adjoint problem\n",
    "$$\n",
    "g'(x) = b(x - c)^3 = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This is a very old problem with many approaches. One is called [the Newton step](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Newton Step\n",

    "## Programming A Root Finding Function\n",

    "2. Evaluate the gradient.\n",
    "3. Choose when to stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we choose when to stop? We can use either a `while` or a `for` loop with a conditional break. But what condition?

    "## Installing Python\n",
    "Next class we will start our two week crash course in Python. To that end you should do the following:\n",
    "1. (NOTE: you should already have this, so try doing question two and if it doesn't work out, return here.) [Go the the Continuum Analytics download page](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) and download the installer for your particular system. **Install Python 3.x! Not Python 2.x.**\n",
    "2. Confirm that Anaconda is installed by running the command `conda list` at the command line. If you are on OSX or Linux, the most common problem is a `PATH` issue, [which can be solved by following these directions](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/troubleshooting#on-os-x-or-linux-what-causes-a-conda-command-not-found-error). If you are having other issues, google them! If you can't find an answer, email me. **Do not come to class without successfully installing Anaconda.**\n",
    "3. Choose a workflow style (text editor + command line (The way of the programmer.) or IDE) and set it up. I personally use [Atom](https://atom.io/) and the command line, but many economists prefer IDE's because they remind them of Matlab (gross). The most common one is [Spyder](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder). If you choose Atom, [I have a step by step guide to setting it up for syntax highlighting and proper tabbing](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/tyler-abbot/PyShop/blob/master/session0/PyShop_session0_exercises.ipynb), 1/3 of the way down.."
